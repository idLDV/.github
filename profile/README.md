### Open Collaboration in Scientific Research: A Dynamic Approach

This project is designed to be a living document, accessible to the public for free and not for profit. As such, it is open to updates and revisions after publication to reflect new findings or to correct any inaccuracies. Furthermore, we welcome discussion and collaboration with other researchers. Forks of this project are encouraged, and improvements can be committed back to the main project. This dynamic approach to academic research aims to foster a more open and collaborative scholarly environment.
